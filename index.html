        <h3>The Early Years</h3>
        <p>
            I started doing ballet, tap, and jazz at a dance studio that had just opened up two blocks from my house.
            I quickly fell in love with it and started taking more classes, like pointe, lyrical, and hip hop.
            I dropped all of the my other extracurricular activities I was doing at the time.
            I advanced through the various levels and joined "Company," which was our studio's competition team.
            It was a huge artistic release for me, and I found out that I really love being on stage despite my intense shyness.

        <p>
            I quit dance my sophomore year of high school because my studio was closing.
            I decided not to find another studio and instead focused on school and different extracurriculars there.
            Honestly, I liked being away from dance; it had become a chore and was detrimental to my health at the time.
            The time away was good for me.

         <h3>College Years</h3>
         <p>
             I went to college and was a psychology major. As one of my required general education clasees, I decided to take a dance class since it had been so long.
             I didn't expect to fall in love with dance all over again, but I did. By the time my sophomore year came around, I was offically a dance major with an emphasis in modern dance.
             I danced 5-6 hours a day while also taking certain academic classes. At night, we would have rehearsal for about 3 hours because we always had a concert coming up.
             In my senior year, my capstone project required me to choreograph and produce my own dance concert. It was incredibly difficult but so rewarding.
             I didn't know what I was going to do after I graduated, but I didn't necessarily care. Dance is what made me happy, so I was going to make it work.

         <h3>Dancing In The Real World</h3>
         <p>
             Throughout the years, I have benn able to perform professionally in several shows in St. Louis.
             I went to a few cities through the United States to audition for various dance companies, but nothing ever panned out.
             For a couple of years, I was part of an aerial dance company here in St. Louis, and that was so much fun!
             Aerial is very physically demanding, so we rehearsed and trained several nights a week.
             I've known that I don't want to be a dance teacher, so work can be hard to come by.
             With needing a steady income, I had to find a day job, and that took over my life. I couldn't fit dance rehearsals into my schedule.
             I am very much hoping to get back into dance someday because I miss it so much.
